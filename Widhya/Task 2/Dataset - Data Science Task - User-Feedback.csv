Top 10% in class,9,The description part in each mission could be more clear and distinct. ,Yes,"Learning never stops. Widhya's learning by doing approach is structured in a way that aims to provide every student an independent and equal platform, a real-time industrial experience, even before they start doing a job or an internship. Widhya's approach is focused on understanding the basic theoretical foundations in the domain. I strongly believe that when you are learning a theoretical concept while doing practically, it makes us better understand. Widhya's way of learning is very much effective because first, it allows us to understand the concept in a comprehensive way. After learning it also allows us to test that knowledge in a step-wise manner. Like the dataset in each mission is very well described. Also, there are clear instructions for each task of the mission. Once, we have a thorough understanding of the problem it becomes very much easy to find a complete solution. The learning is completely aimed to give theoretical as well the practical knowledge about various concepts in Data Science and Machine Learning.",9,Widhya's way of learning was effective for me because it is purely based on performance. The learning approach believes in quality and efforts to get good results. Not just overall results but performance for each sub-task of the mission is also evaluated. Clearing these sub-tasks made me feel more confident about the concepts in the domain. In this even beginners stand a fair chance to compete with intermediate and advance coders for this internship as Widhya's way of learning believes in transparency.,Yes,Yes,140,Data Science Mission,Yes,"The Missions were the most effective way of learning. It helped me in brushing up the learned theoretical concepts and the coding skills.

Data Science is a vast domain and it requires immense practice to call out each concept while coding. The micro tasks of the missions helped me in recollecting various concepts which I have learned years ago. For example, the first time I learned Linear Regression was in the year 2017. But, with missions on Widhya's platform I feel more confident about my knowledge now.

Top 10% in class,9,The description part in each mission could be more clear and distinct. ,Yes,"Learning never stops. Widhya's learning by doing approach is structured in a way that aims to provide every student an independent and equal platform, a real-time industrial experience, even before they start doing a job or an internship. Widhya's approach is focused on understanding the basic theoretical foundations in the domain. I strongly believe that when you are learning a theoretical concept while doing practically, it makes us better understand. Widhya's way of learning is very much effective because first, it allows us to understand the concept in a comprehensive way. After learning it also allows us to test that knowledge in a step-wise manner. Like the dataset in each mission is very well described. Also, there are clear instructions for each task of the mission. Once, we have a thorough understanding of the problem it becomes very much easy to find a complete solution. The learning is completely aimed to give theoretical as well the practical knowledge about various concepts in Data Science and Machine Learning.",9,Widhya's way of learning was effective for me because it is purely based on performance. The learning approach believes in quality and efforts to get good results. Not just overall results but performance for each sub-task of the mission is also evaluated. Clearing these sub-tasks made me feel more confident about the concepts in the domain. In this even beginners stand a fair chance to compete with intermediate and advance coders for this internship as Widhya's way of learning believes in transparency.,Yes,Yes,140,Data Science Mission,Yes,"The Missions were the most effective way of learning. It helped me in brushing up the learned theoretical concepts and the coding skills. Thinking and selecting the right answer for each micro task made me feel more confident and determined to do the further questions. Also, the evaluation is strictly based on solving each micro task of the mission.",2,More micro-tasks could be added that focuses more on coding.,9,Yes,Few multiple choice questions could be added.,10,10,10,Yes,"Each mission is based on various concepts of the domain. Data Science is a vast domain and it requires immense practice to call out each concept while coding. The micro tasks of the missions helped me in recollecting various concepts which I have learned years ago. For example, the first time I learned Linear Regression was in the year 2017. But, with missions on Widhya's platform I feel more confident about my knowledge now. Also, I learned doing these micro tasks on both R-Studio and Python platform.","More concepts like Forecasting, Time Series, Market Basket Analysis and Recommendation System could be covered in the further missions.",To locate a specific value in a column of the data.
